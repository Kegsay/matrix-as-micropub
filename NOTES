IndieAuth
---------
- User invites @micropub:domain to a private room
- >>> !indieauth <url>
- <<< https://yourdomain/oauth
- Do the dance (POST back results in:)
- <<< You are now authenticated as <domain> for <user_id>

AS now has a 3-uple (uid, domain, token)

Micropub => Matrix
==================

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED:
- OAuth sign in to Matrix account (HS *is* an OAuth endpoint; different from reg/login using OAuth)

- AS exposes /entry (or w/e the rel="micropub" link says)
- Expect valid token in request
- Accept only h=entry for now
- map content field directly onto m.room.message
- Detect HTML and use org.matrix.custom.html ?
- AS then sends message as <user_id> to ???

Matrix => Micropub
==================
AS acts as a web app.

- Send message in private room with @micropub:domain
- Map message to micropub entry
- Hit out to <url> with micropub, using <token>.
